<br># Openbox Initial setup
<br>We need the Community Repository available for access to the Openbox packages.
<br>#nano /etc/apk/repositories  
<br>
<br>Install the basic packages for a minimal installation:
<br># apk add openbox xterm font-terminus
<br>
<br>xterm is needed so you have a way to access the terminal in X. 
<br>Terminus is needed because without any fonts, you will not be able to see any text in Openbox.
<br>
<br>On most systems, xorg should be able to auto-detect all devices. 
<br>Install the base xorg packages by running:
<br># setup-xorg-base
<br>
<br>Configure user with #apk adduser
<br>To make Xorg work as normal user you need to add user to these groups: video, input.
<br># addgroup "username" input
<br># addgroup "username" video
<br>
<br>acpid
<br>If you installed your Alpine Linux as a VirtualBox or VMWare guest, 
<br>you might find it handy to be able execute an ACPI shutdown.
<br># rc-update add acpid
<br>
<br>Set Openbox as the default WM
<br>$ echo 'exec openbox-session' >> ~/.xinitrc
<br>Copy the config files to your home folder
<br>$ mkdir ~/.config
<br>$ cp -r /etc/xdg/openbox ~/.config
<br>
<br>Note: The default configuration is minimal and most menu options won't work 
<br>unless you customize and/or install additional packages. 
<br>
<br>You can now edit the Openbox settings for your user by editing the files located in 
<br>~/.config/openbox  #(autostart, rc.xml, menu.xml)
<br>
<br>Start X
<br>$ startx
<br>
<br>Note: The default Openbox menu (right-click on desktop) will have a lot of options 
<br>that won't work because the required packages haven't been installed. 
<br>XTerm will work if you added the package in the first step, and you can use that 
<br>to add additional packages.
